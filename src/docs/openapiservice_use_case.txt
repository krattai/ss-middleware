Limited doc/ref of OpenApiService:

The SS/SU (Sun-Sky / Sun-USB) file format is JSON (or JSON like; but most likely JSON, although doc and ref info is extremely limited, so inconclusive)

The use case is to request initial data from SS/SU and store in local database.

The data can be referenced in "real-time" on the web app, although this could be very resource intensive, so utlizing a local dataset is likely more effective and efficient.

Once items have been selected for aquisition, a request to get prices and shipping costs would be made to SS/SU.  This seems a little counter intuitive for prices, as they should already be current and local, although it would be good use to ensure prices had not changed.

Finally, on order confirmaation, the order would be submitted to SS/SU for processing.
